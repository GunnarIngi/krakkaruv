INTRODUCTION
------------

  The KrakkaRUV Hlaðborð module was a request from the administrators, in order to have a semi-
  automatic way to control the main Hlaðborð on the front page.

  Basic requirements were to be able to determine how many of each category
  (horfa/hlusta/skapa/leika) would be selected into the Hlaðborð.  Then to be able to pin
  a certain category for the first place (larger image).

  Secondary requirements were to be able to pin certain nodes into fixed places, were they would
  be pinned until unpinned.
