; Shownid is a module defining a block that will display the current Node ID
; or Taxonomy Term ID and in the future perhaps other relevant id's to people
; logged on and having the necessary privileges.
; It's intended as a tool for site admins and editors who need to know the
; NID quickly without hovering over the "edit" -button and inspecting the link.
